I find that it is one of the most rewarding and important things to do, even if that is devoting 45 minutes a day in order to keep yourself feeling good. </h5>

          <p id="fitness-love-two" class="fw-bold text-center"> The second I set foot in the gym, instantly I knew it would be an extreme challenge for me, and because of that, my dedication slowly started to build. Many years down the line after I had went to the gym as consistently as I possibly could, something clicked in my head and at that moment, I decided to dedicate as much time as I had in my free time to bettering myself physically, and mentally.</p>
