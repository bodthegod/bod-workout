    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to have access to a website that allows me to explore reliable and trustworthy information about fitness and wellbeing, allowing me to adapt my lifestyle for a positive change, for medical or personal reasons. 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to have easy access to every page possible, as it is a website to provide valuable information for people interested in the subject of fitness, the easier the pages are to access, the more likely a user is to explore the website and return to it.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see how relatable the content is to a newgoer or intermediate trainer within the gym, as this is the target audience. This website is intended to encourage those users to rely on it for valuable information that can be used to better themselves.

        5. Any first time user interested in getting in contact with me regarding a workout plan or personal advice catered to their needs, shall see a contact button presented within the navigation bar so they could go straight to the section of the website they desire.

    -   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The main colours I have used are a charcoal grey, grey and white- this is to provide a nice and easy to read website, with a little extra added depth to mix it up for the user reading it.

    -   #### Typography

        -   I have chose the Quicksand font as the main font used within the body of my website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site from the external link. Quicksand is a sleek and attractive font that seems relaxed and easy on the eyes, deeming this appropriate for the general text of my website. I have also used the Comfortaa font for my h1's and h2's, this having a higher font weight to further emphasise the importance of the text within these headings. Cursive is also the fallback for this font- incase the website doesn't load the fonts correctly the user will never be without an attractive and appropriate font.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   I have a hero image when first opening the page, that is slightly blurred out to create a focus on the text that is inside of it. This catches the users attention immediately, and with the use of a box shadow, this further emphasises the focus on the text- which tells the user the exact purpose of the website so that they can make a decision if it interests them. Without this imagery, the first segment that you see of the website would be less likely to draw the users attention, as the image shows an empty gym with nice bright lighting, to emphasise a good mood (brightness through windows in gym) and fitness.
