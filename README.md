    -   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The main colours I have used are a charcoal grey, #df710b and white- this is to provide a nice and easy to read website, with a little extra added depth to mix it up for the user reading it. I have also used an orange colour (#df710b) as a secondary colour, occasionally spotted across buttons on the website, the logo on the top left, and the underlines. This colour is used to give the website a familiar feel to a user if they return at a later date- I also used this shade of orange as it is appropriate to my topic of the website, fitness- this is appropriate as orange is considered an active colour, vibrant and lively.

    -   #### Typography

        -   I have chose the Quicksand font as the main font used within the body of my website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site from the external link. Quicksand is a sleek and attractive font that seems relaxed and easy on the eyes, deeming this appropriate for the general text of my website. I have also used the Comfortaa font for my h1's and h2's, this having a higher font weight to further emphasise the importance of the text within these headings. Cursive is also the fallback for this font- incase the website doesn't load the fonts correctly the user will never be without an attractive and appropriate font.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   I have a hero image when first opening the page, that is slightly blurred out to create a focus on the text that is inside of it. This catches the users attention immediately, and with the use of a box shadow, this further emphasises the focus on the text- which tells the user the exact purpose of the website so that they can make a decision if it interests them. Without this imagery, the first segment that you see of the website would be less likely to draw the users attention, as the image shows an empty gym with nice bright lighting, to emphasise a good mood (brightness through windows in the gym) and fitness. I also have a parralax image in the background when you scroll down to the "My Love for Fitness" section, this image has some bright and easy to look at gym equipment, which is blurred out but gives the website a refreshing look. I used this imagery to keep the website looking fun and interactive to the user, giving them the insentive to read further into the information displayed.

        I have three more images displayed within cards of the supplement section of my website, these images are used to give the user a clear understanding of what supplements I recommend, with a corresponding link to a website with said supplement. This is a good use of imagery as the user will be familiar with the supplement without seeing the website that they are sold on first, establishing a positive response from a user. This positive response is helpful as they may return at a later date, to check what other supplements I recommend- as they can see them on the website from a click of a button.

    *   ### Wireframes
        
    -   I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) as my desired wireframing tool for this website, as it is very easy to use. However, due to these being wireframes, the final image of the website may be depicted differently yet these are base guidelines of my website, and the image I would like to achieve. Here I have created Home, Advice and Contact page wireframes, all with desktop and mobile wireframes along with it.

### Screenshots and features within website

####   Home page
-   [Top of Home Page](/readmeimages/Home-page-one.jpg)
    This screenshot shows the first view a user will see every time they load up the site, this displays some brief information to the user about the use of the website, shown on a box with a box shadow and blurred background to really focus the user and define the use that they will have from it.
-   [Middle of Home Page](/readmeimages/Home-page-two.png)
    This portion of the website gives the user information about my personal journey through fitness, to allow them to dictate the value of the website. There are also buttons shown to the user that can redirect them to a page for beginners or intermediate trainers, catering to multiple audiences.
-   [Lower of Home Page](/readmeimages/Home-page-three.png)
    Here on the lower part of the home page, the user is given a brief understanding about why I am passionate about fitness, shown on a parallax image to catch the eye of the user.- another effort to allow them to dictate the value of information being presented. There is also a basic fitness video about beginner gym mistakes, showing them that I understand where they may be and that the information on the website is an effort to be helpful.
-   [Bottom of Home Page](/readmeimages/Home-page-four.png)
    The final section of the home page on my website shows supplements that I regularly use- with brief descriptions and images of the product also with a 'Visit Supplement' button, which will open a new tab for the user to purchase or browse what I recommend. Finally- there are social links at the bottom of the page, for them to find more information and contact me if they desire.

####   Beginner page
-   [Beginner Page](/readmeimages/Beginner-page-one.png)
    Within this page, basic information with icons is displayed to assist a beginner trainer within the gym some rough guidance and my personal opinion on things to focus on at that stage of training. There is also a button below to redirect the user to the intermediate page, and social links.

####   Intermediate page
-   [Intermediate Page](/readmeimages/Intermediate-page-one.png)
    This page on my website is very similar to the beginner page, however the information is different and more focused towards the intermediate group, and the icons are different. Also, there is a button to take the user to the supplements section of the website, as I believe that is a need from a user that is at the intermediate stage of training. Social links are displayed too.

####   Contact page
-   [Contact Page](/readmeimages/Contact-page-one.png)
    The contact page within my website is very simple, and offers the user a few boxes to enter information, and radio buttons too. There is a submit button to submit the data, and the box that all the information is displayed in follows the website style. Social links are also here.

### Languages Used

-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)



### Resources Used

-   Throughout coding this whole website, I have used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) to assist me in making a responsive and attractive website. This has been essential as there are already predefined classes within bootstrap, allowing for quick coding, making me more effective and time efficient when coding. There were many times when coding when I got stuck, however due to the search ability within bootstrap and researching the issues I had, it allowed me to create a fix and carry on developing.

-   I have also used the W3 [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) validator, and occasionally the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) resources when I had an issue.

-   For imagery, I used a royalty free website called [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/gym/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/gym/) for my gym photos, and google for the images of the supplements.

-   For my box shadows and unique box border radius, I used [BoxShadowGenerator] https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/

-   For compressing my images, I used [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)

-   For testing my website on different screen sizes, I used [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/)

-   For media query info, I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)

-   For styling inspiration, I used [ColorMind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/)


### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Bootstrap 4.4.1:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Comfortaa' font and 'Quicksand' into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project 
    (maintains a certain style).
1. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used on all pages within the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes, giving clear indication of social media links, and 
    giving visual indicators to the information on the advice pages.
1. [jQuery:](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript, allowing for a smooth scroll down to the desired section that is clicked.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub, this was used throughout the development of the website
    and was essential.
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
1. [BeFunky:](https://www.befunky.com/features/blur-image/)
    - Befunky was used to blur the parallax image as there were bugs when using the css blur function.
1. [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the [wireframes](/wireframes/) during the design process.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. In addition to this, I used Chrome Dev tools very often to play around with the code and test when I was having issues. I found this was extremely important when troubleshooting issues- as I could change the code and see the changes live, instead of having to save the file and force refresh (If I changed the CSS code).

The use of chrome dev tools allowed me to play around with the breakpoints for different screen sizes, and helped me achieve the look I desire for on smaller screen sizes.

### Further Testing

-   I tested my website on many different screen sizes using the inspect element web tool, which allowed for me to test specific breakpoints and the layout on different hardware.
-   I tested my website on Google chrome and Safari, as these browsers interacted differently and I had to plan accordingly by editing features for IOS (my parallax).
-   I had tested every single page and link to ensure they were all functioning correctly, and redirects the user to the correct area within the website.
-   I asked friends to give me a review of the website and possible tips they think I could improve on, and had them bug test it as well as myself.

### Known Bugs

-   On IOS the parallax image doesn't display correctly so I had to edit this to dispay as static, so I blurred the image and made the text visible over the static image.
-   There was a bug where my video wouldn't play, however I edited the size and positioning to fix this.
-   The images within the cards didn't show on the live site, and all that would show was the alt tags. In order to fix this, I changed the path of the images within the hyperlink.
-   The top hero image would stretch and display too big, and would stretch on mobile devices. To fix this, I changed the max-width.
-   The nav bar wouldn't function correctly on mobile, so I added the burger icon via bootstrap for ease of use.
